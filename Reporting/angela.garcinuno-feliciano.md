Created creature energy and creature states (Alive / Dead). Created the update energy function as well as the basic functions (get, change)

2nd week (27.11.2023 - 04.12.2023)

Separated health and energy. Creatures now have health (initialized at 100). Health and energy are limited at 100 and they can be converted from one to another. Modified the death condition so it depends on health instead of energy.

Fixed some bugs in health and energy, added age to creatures. Age limits the max energy of creatures.
