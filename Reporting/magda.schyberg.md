Week 1
* Accomplishments: Downloaded necessary packages for project functionality.
* Challenges: Encountered significant issues in getting the project to run properly on my computer

Week 2
* Collaborated extensively with the TA to resolve project opening issues. 
* Assisted a partner with their coding tasks and discussed strategies for implementing the energy. 
* Limitations: Due to extensive time spent on resolving technical issues, my contribution was primarily inputs to someone else’s code on their computer.

Week 3
* Accomplishments: Successfully implemented the 'creature density' button. This involved comprehending the engine's structure for effective integration, modifying several functions, and ensuring the simulation restarts with any change in creature density.
* Challenges: Required substantial updates to the restart function to include the creation of a new environment, which was initially problematic.

Week 4
* Accomplishments: Resolved issues with the 'creature density' button, which was not updating the density values correctly anymore, despite restarting the game. Identified and fixed the underlying problem after thorough investigation.

Week 5
* Accomplishments: Set up the 'grab' functionality.  I Added an output neuron for grabbing (bool value). Set up the grab function in creature (it lowers energy, sets which entity is grabbed/grabbing in GrabbingEntity class, calls the function that updates their velocity). 
* Updated the UI with enhanced buttons, though these changes were not adopted in the main project.

Week 6
* Planned Tasks: Addressing the 'GrabbingEntity' class issue to avoid double velocity updates and modifying the grabbing mechanism to set rotational velocity to zero. Challenges: Delayed due to awaiting the completion of a related function by a team member, who faced unresolved issues. Several people tried helping fix this issue but unsuccesful. My tasks are postponed to when the function is completed.

Week 7
* My goal this week was to Implement a feature for saving the data of a selected creature, enhancing the project's data management capabilities. However, a technical issu on Macs prevented me from doing so. Clicking on creatures was not possible on macs (issue got resolved but it took a week to get resolved…)
