# Week 1
- Organized Notion infrastructure
- Divided tasks for the "entity creation" project
- Created a Food Generation function
- Helped define some of the class structure of the project

# Week 2
- Divided tasks for the "system links" project
- Created a reproduction function with all of the corresponding adjustments 
- Implemented reproduction into the game loop using a queue

# Week 3
- Took care of organizing the "system-links" project
- Fixed multiple problems with pointer management that ended up causing segmentation faults
- Researched how to implement procedural sprite generation
- Build the brain-creature interface
- Achieved the first instance of evolution in our project
- Documented the entire codebase so that it's compatible with Doxygen

# Week 4
- Fixed different bugs with the UI and Windows interfaces that use the screen ampliation recommended settings
- Fixed two bugs that caused the new movement system to allow creatures to reach infinite speeds by exploiting errors in the system
- Researched how to implement species categorization with clustering algorithms
- Implemented mutable project allowing size, energy storage, and other characteristics to be subject to natural selection  

# Week 5
- Research how to deal with files during compilation and figure out how to access files using the QResources handler
- Worked on a complete revamp of the UI looks and created different sprites to substitute the previous buttons
- Created sprites with procedural generation depending on size, eye type, and tail type (which depend on mutable properties)
- Implemented simple shaders to be able to have sprites with a similar color palette for different hues.
- Implemented zoom capabilities
- Implemented the reproduction restrictions so that only species within compatibility range reproduce
